# HOLD IT, THINKING WHEN DON'T KNOW ANYTHING :)

“Does this code belong here?”

“Am I repeating myself?” -> DRY

“Can this file be reused or generalized?”

“Can another developer understand this without asking me?”

##  STEP-BY-STEP BRAIN MAP 
Client-Server behavior:

    Server: wait for clients, receive data, respond
    Client: connect to server, send message, get respone


🎯 Goal → 🔧 Responsibility → 📁 File → 🧪 Test → 🔁 Reuse → 🧹 Clean → 🧠 Understand

1. 🎯 Goal
    1. Connect client to server
    2. Server can handle request of client
    3. Server can respone it
2. 🔧 Responsibility
    1. Server: respone, receive
    2. Client: request
